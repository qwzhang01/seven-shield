/**
 * Annotation for marking email address fields that require masking.
 *
 * <p>This annotation specifically targets email address fields and applies
 * email masking algorithm. The email masking typically keeps the first and
 * last characters of the username while masking the middle part, leaving
 * the domain unchanged.</p>
 *
 * <p>This annotation is a specialized version of {@link Mask} annotation
 * with EmailCoverAlgo as the default masking algorithm.</p>
 *
 * <p>Usage example:</p>
 * <pre>
 * public class User {
 *     {@code @MaskEmail}
 *     private String email; // Will be masked as u***r@example.com
 * }
 * </pre>

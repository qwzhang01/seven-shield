/**
 * Annotation for marking phone number fields that require masking.
 *
 * <p>This annotation specifically targets phone number fields and applies
 * phone number masking algorithm by default. The phone number masking
 * typically keeps the first 3 and last 4 digits while masking the middle
 * digits.</p>
 *
 * <p>Usage example:</p>
 * <pre>
 * public class User {
 *     {@code @MaskPhone}
 *     private String phoneNumber; // Will be masked as 138****5678
 * }
 * </pre>
